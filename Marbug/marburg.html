                    <h2>Marburg virus disease (MVD) </h2>
                    <p>Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a rare but severe hemorrhagic fever which affects both people and non-human primates. MVD is caused by the Marburg virus, a genetically unique zoonotic (or, animal-borne) RNA virus of the filovirus family. The six species of Ebola virus are the only other known members of the filovirus family.</p>
                    <p>Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967, when outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever occurred simultaneously in laboratories in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Thirty-one people became ill, initially laboratory workers followed by several medical personnel and family members who had cared for them. Seven deaths were reported. The first people infected had been exposed to Ugandan imported African green monkeys or their tissues while conducting research. One additional case was diagnosed retrospectively.</p>
                    <p>The reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus. Fruit bats infected with Marburg virus do not show obvious signs of illness. Primates (including people) can become infected with Marburg virus, and may develop serious disease with high mortality. Further study is needed to determine if other species may also host the virus.</p>

            <!--SYMPTOMS-->
            <div id="symtoms" class="item">
                <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <div>
                        <p>After an incubation period of 2-21 days, symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash, most prominent on the trunk (chest, back, stomach), may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may appear. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction.</p>
                        <p>Clinical diagnosis of Marburg virus disease (MVD) can be difficult. Many of the signs and symptoms of MVD are similar to other infectious diseases (such as malaria or typhoid fever) or viral hemorrhagic fevers that may be endemic in the area (such as Lassa fever or Ebola). This is especially true if only a single case is involved.</p>
                        <p>The case-fatality rate for MVD is between 23-90%.</p>

            <!--TRANSMISSION-->
            <div id="transmission" class="item">
                <h2>Transmission</h2>
                <p>It is unknown how Marburg virus first spreads from its animal host to people; however, for the 2 cases in tourists visiting Uganda in 2008, unprotected contact with infected bat feces or aerosols are the most likely routes of infection.</p>
                <p>After this initial crossover of virus from host animal to people, transmission occurs through person-to-person contact. The virus spreads through direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood or body fluids* (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and semen) of a person who is sick with or died from Marburg virus disease, or</li>
                    <li>Objects contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from Marburg virus disease (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).</li>
                    <li>Semen from a man who recovered from MVD (through oral, vaginal, or anal sex). The virus can remain in certain body fluids (including semen) of a patient who has recovered from MVD, even if they no longer have symptoms of severe illness. There is no evidence that Marburg virus can spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had MVD.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Spread of the virus between people has occurred in close environments and among direct contacts. A common example is through caregivers in the home or in a hospital (nosocomial transmission).</p>
                <p>In previous outbreaks, people who have handled infected non-human primates or have come in direct contact with their body fluids have become infected with Marburg virus. Laboratory exposures can also occur when lab staff handle live Marburg virus.</p>

            <div id="prevention" class="item">
                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <p>Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the viruses. The following precautions can help prevent infection and spread of Ebola virus and Marburg virus.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid areas of known outbreaks.</strong> Before traveling to Africa, find out about current epidemics by checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wash your hands frequently.</strong> As with other infectious diseases, one of the most important preventive measures is frequent hand-washing. Use soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water aren't available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid bush meat.</strong> In developing countries, avoid buying or eating the wild animals, including nonhuman primates, sold in local markets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid contact with infected people.</strong> In particular, caregivers should avoid contact with an infected person's body fluids and tissues, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and saliva. Also avoid the person's clothing, bedding or other items that may have touched him or her. People with Ebola virus or Marburg virus are most contagious in the later stages of the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow infection-control procedures.</strong> If you're a health care worker, wear specialized personal protective equipment that covers you from head to toe. Keep people who have the viruses isolated from others. Safely throw away needles and sterilize other instruments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't handle remains</strong>. The bodies of people who have died of Ebola virus or Marburg virus are still contagious. Specially organized and trained teams should bury the remains, using appropriate safety equipment.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There is no specific treatment for Marburg virus disease.

                <p>Experimental treatments are validated in non-human primate models but have never been tried in humans.</p>
